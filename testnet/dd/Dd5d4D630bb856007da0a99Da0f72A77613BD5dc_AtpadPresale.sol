    @notice This is a Natspec commented contract by AtomPad Development Team
    @notice Version v1.1.6 date: jan 12, 2022
    
    v1.1.7
        - added setAllocPercentage()
        - now admin can fill this contract with users and allocpercentage

    v1.1.6
        - removed userConnect()
        - added logic of userConnect in swap
        - checked swap for remaining allocation
        - changed getUserAllocated to calc allocation based on allocPoints

    v1.1.5
        - final test on testNet
        - set rate to 100 , that is 0.1 wantToken for 1 investToken
        - initiate swapOn = false
        - initiate claimOn = false
        - added nonReentrant to functions swap(), swapClaim(), userConnect()

    v1.1.4 
        - includes maxTransfer checks to avoid overspending in swapClaim;
            check1: if (_free > 100) _free = 100;
            check2: just before transfer, if overspending then revert
            if ( claims[msg.sender].claimed > claims[msg.sender].reserved ) {
                // revert transaction
            }
        - including max percentage check on getReleasedPercentage()
            check3: if (block.timestamp > endVest) return 100;

        - rate include rateDecimals = 3
            uint public rate = 100000; // -->  this is 100 * (10**3) 
            claims[msg.sender].reserved = (swaps[msg.sender] * rate).div(1000); -->  // this is 100000 / (10**3)

        - getters for frontend
            to be determined after this test
    

    v1.1.3
    - restore payable since v1.1.0 did not work
    - we need to depositTokens after claim
    - set rate fixed value.. not by depositTokens
    - set rate = 1
    - mapping(address=> uint) private allocations;  // allocations to private
    - removed struct Allocation {
        address adres;
        uint allocated;     
        uint swapped;       
    }

     - function depositTokens(uint _amount) external payable onlyOwner claimDisabled whenNotStarted

        ( try to avoid gas )  
        - set allocations private
        - mapping(address=> uint) private allocations;

        --> !!! test for gas fees !!!!


    function swapClaim() external payable

/** @notice What is AtpadPresale
    PresaleTest provides launch system for an ido. build from scratch 28.09.2021 by AtomPad Dev Team for a basic understanding 
    AtpadPresale is a major update on 06.01.22
    This contract works in conjunction with StakePool.sol 
    This contract is inherited by PresaleTestFees.sol
*/

/** @notice How the contract works
    stakepool.sol is up and running and accounts stake the stakeTokens they are holding
    admin sets hardcap (investToken) and deposits tokens (wantToken) 
    the calculation tokenSupply / hardcap gives the amount of tokens a user gets per investment
    stakePool.sol provides allocPerc, this is the percentage allocation a user holds. 
    this contract does not bother how allocPerc is determined.
    allocPerc is a relative value and has to be divide by 10**6 to get the absoolute %. 
    in other words.... (100% = 1000 000 allocPerc points)
    
    if a user connects once the presale hast started.. the allocation how many investToken a user can spend is calculated.
    also the amount of wantToken a user will receive is based on the same calculation
    example: 
    if the hardcap is 50, the tokenSupply is 10 000 and the allocPerc for userA is 10 000 then 
    userA has the allocation  for 1% in this presale , this is 0.5 investToken.
    userA will receive 100 tokens if the maximum allocation is swapped

    if a user does not connect between startTime and endTime, the reserved allocation will be lost. 
    if a user allocates but does not swap the allocated invesTokens, the reserved allocation will be lost.

    Version 1.1 has completely changed the vesting of claims
    new  vesting variables
    uint initialVestPercentage;  use 100 for NO VESTING
    
    ///  Epoch timestamps START and END vesting 
    uint startVest;
    uint endVest;
       
    initialVestPercentage = 50
    startVest = 1643716800;  //  Epoch timestamp:  Date and time (GMT): Tuesday 1 February 2022 12:00:00
    endVest = 1669896000;  // Epoch timestamp:  Date and time (GMT): Thursday 1 December 2022 12:00:00

contract AtpadPresale is ReentrancyGuard, Ownable, Pausable {

    /** @dev libraries
        @dev ReentrancyGuard 
            Helps to prevent reentrant calls to a function.
            Inheriting from ReentrancyGuard will make the nonReentrant modifier available, which can be applied to functions to make sure there are no nested (reentrant) calls to them.
            Note that because there is a single nonReentrant guard, functions marked as nonReentrant may not call one another. This can be worked around by making those functions private, and then adding external nonReentrant entry points to them.

        @dev Ownable 
            Provides a basic access control mechanism, where there is an account (an owner) that can be granted exclusive access to specific functions.
            By default, the owner account will be the one that deploys the contract. This can later be changed with transferOwnership.
            This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifier onlyOwner, which can be applied to your functions to restrict their use to the owner.

        @dev Pausable 
            This is an emergency stop mechanism that can be triggered by an authorized account.
            This module is used through inheritance. It will make available the modifiers whenNotPaused and whenPaused, which can be applied to the functions of your contract. 
            Note that they will not be pausable by simply including this module, only once the modifiers are put in place.
        
        @dev IERC20 
            Interface of the ERC20 standard as defined in the EIP. Does not include the optional functions; to access them see ERC20Detailed.
            totalSupply()
            balanceOf(account)
            transfer(recipient, amount)
            allowance(owner, spender)
            approve(spender, amount)
            transferFrom(sender, recipient, amount)

        @dev SafeERC20 
            Wraps around ERC20 operations that throw on failure (when the token contract returns false). 
            Tokens that return no value (and instead revert or throw on failure) are also supported, non-reverting calls are assumed to be successful. 

        @dev SafeMath 
            Provides mathematical functions that protect your contract from overflows and underflows.
            Include the contract with using SafeMath for uint256; and then call the functions:
            myNumber.add(otherNumber)    myNumber.sub(otherNumber)   myNumber.div(otherNumber)
            myNumber.mul(otherNumber)    myNumber.mod(otherNumber)
            late note J.Orbit: SafeMath may be obsolete pragma : 0.8.9

        @dev EnumerableMap
            This is like mapping type, but with key-value enumeration: 
            informs how many entries a mapping has, and iterate over them (which is not possible with mapping).
            EnumerableSet: like EnumerableMap, but for sets. Can be used to store privileged accounts, issued IDs, etc.
