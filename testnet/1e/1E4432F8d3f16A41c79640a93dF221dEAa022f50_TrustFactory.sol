/// @title Trust
/// @notice Coordinates the mediation and distribution of tokens
/// between stakeholders.
///
/// The `Trust` contract is responsible for configuring the
/// `RedeemableERC20` token, `RedeemableERC20Pool` Balancer wrapper
/// and the `SeedERC20` contract.
///
/// Internally the `TrustFactory` calls several admin/owner only
/// functions on its children and these may impose additional
/// restrictions such as `Phased` limits.
///
/// The `Trust` builds and references `RedeemableERC20`,
/// `RedeemableERC20Pool` and `SeedERC20` contracts internally and
/// manages all access-control functionality.
///
/// The major functions of the `Trust` contract, apart from building
/// and configuring the other contracts, is to start and end the
/// fundraising event, and mediate the distribution of funds to the
/// correct stakeholders:
///
/// - On `Trust` construction, all minted `RedeemableERC20` tokens
///   are sent to the `RedeemableERC20Pool`
/// - `anonStartDistribution` can be called by anyone to begin the
///   Dutch Auction. This will revert if this is called before seeder reserve
///   funds are available on the `Trust`.
/// - `anonEndDistribution` can be called by anyone (only when
///   `RedeemableERC20Pool` is in `Phase.TWO`) to end the Dutch Auction
///   and distribute funds to the correct stakeholders, depending on
///   whether or not the auction met the fundraising target.
///   - On successful raise
///     - seed funds are returned to `seeder` address along with
///       additional `seederFee` if configured
///     - `redeemInit` is sent to the `redeemableERC20` address, to back
///       redemptions
///     - the `creator` gets the remaining balance, which should
///       equal or exceed `minimumCreatorRaise`
///   - On failed raise
///     - seed funds are returned to `seeder` address
///     - the remaining balance is sent to the `redeemableERC20` address, to
///       back redemptions
///     - the `creator` gets nothing
/// @dev Mediates stakeholders and creates internal Balancer pools and tokens
/// for a distribution.
///
/// The goals of a distribution:
/// - Mint and distribute a `RedeemableERC20` as fairly as possible,
///   prioritising true fans of a creator.
/// - Raise a minimum reserve so that a creator can deliver value to fans.
/// - Provide a safe space through membership style filters to enhance
///   exclusivity for fans.
/// - Ensure that anyone who seeds the raise (not fans) by risking and
///   providing capital is compensated.
///
/// Stakeholders:
/// - Creator: Have a project of interest to their fans
/// - Fans: Will purchase project-specific tokens to receive future rewards
///   from the creator
/// - Seeder(s): Provide initial reserve assets to seed a Balancer trading pool
/// - Deployer: Configures and deploys the `Trust` contract
///
/// The creator is nominated to receive reserve assets on a successful
/// distribution. The creator must complete the project and fans receive
/// rewards. There is no on-chain mechanism to hold the creator accountable to
/// the project completion. Requires a high degree of trust between creator and
/// their fans.
///
/// Fans are willing to trust and provide funds to a creator to complete a
/// project. Fans likely expect some kind of reward or "perks" from the
/// creator, such as NFTs, exclusive events, etc.
/// The distributed tokens are untransferable after trading ends and merely act
/// as records for who should receive rewards.
///
/// Seeders add the initial reserve asset to the Balancer pool to start the
/// automated market maker (AMM).
/// Ideally this would not be needed at all.
/// Future versions of `Trust` may include a bespoke distribution mechanism
/// rather than Balancer contracts. Currently it is required by Balancer so the
/// seeder provides some reserve and receives a fee on successful distribution.
/// If the distribution fails the seeder is returned their initial reserve
/// assets. The seeder is expected to promote and mentor the creator in
/// non-financial ways.
///
/// The deployer has no specific priviledge or admin access once the `Trust` is
/// deployed. They provide the configuration, including nominating
/// creator/seeder, and pay gas but that is all.
/// The deployer defines the conditions under which the distribution is
/// successful. The seeder/creator could also act as the deployer.
///
/// Importantly the `Trust` contract is the owner/admin of the contracts it
/// creates. The `Trust` never transfers ownership so it directly controls all
/// internal workflows. No stakeholder, even the deployer or creator, can act
/// as owner of the internals.
