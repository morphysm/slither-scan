//Last Chance Before bear

//It is under these difficult conditions that we deliver our latest work.
//Last Chance Before Bear is a token created by the people and for the people.
//It was created for all the people who have been lied to and taken advantage of. 
//This is the ultimate opportunity to help each other out and show all those scammers
//that we are above it all, that we are a tight knit community and that we can do it
//together. It won't be easy, this project will inherit the investment of all of us.
//Satoshi created bitcoin, Team Rocket and Mr. Sirer allowed Avalanche to be born and
//in the continuation of this lineage working for the decentralization and freedom of
//men we deliver our token and our ideology. We invest our own savings in order to launch
//this ideal and provide the first LPs that will then be burned. The token will be given
//to those who have been betrayed by the projects they believed in.

//Here is how the distribution will be made to the different holders:

//Sdog: 20% of the supply
//Glorycoin: 5% of the supply
//Osiris: 5% of the supply
//Chihuahuax: 10% of the supply

//No token will be kept by the team, all the rest will be used for the liquidity providing of the token.

//WAGMI
