     * - When `from` and `to` are both non-zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens
     * of token type `id` will be  transferred to `to`.
     * - When `from` is zero, `amount` tokens of token type `id` will be minted
     * for `to`.
     * - when `to` is zero, `amount` of ``from``'s tokens of token type `id`
     * will be burned.
     * - `from` and `to` are never both zero.
