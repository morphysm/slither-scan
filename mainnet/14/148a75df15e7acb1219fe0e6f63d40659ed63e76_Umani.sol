/**
 * 
 * The YourCoin contract itself has been heavily annotated to allow all frens
 * to understand what is going on. It is meant to be as transparent
 * as possible in explaining what each privileged function does, why it's needed,
 * the foreseen risks they present and the mitigation of those risks.
 * 
 * To that end, each privileged function is annotated in 4 parts as follows:
 * 
 * Function: [What the function does].
 * 
 * Justification: [Why it's in the contract].
 * 
 * Risk statement: [What the risks in principle are].
 * 
 * Mitigation: [How the risks are to be minimized].
 * 
 * The following global mitigation applies to the notion that the owner's private keys could 
 * be compromised and the malicious actor could call any number of the many privileged functions
 * or dump from the Fren Co. wallets:
 * 
 * "The owner recognises that its private keys are a potential single point of failure
 * since they could be compromised by a malicious actor. The owner is experienced in security 
 * and assures that the private keys will be carefully guarded and stored on an airgapped Qubes
 * machines. A multisig wallet could also be used in the future to provide additional assurance. 
 * A time-lock is unlikely to be added as the owner feels it would hamstring the project's agility,
 * and ability to resolve issues that may arise, such as an individual unable to withdraw tokens 
 * from a pool because it would violate the max Tx or max wallet rules. Being able to adjust the 
 * tokenomics on demand is a core tenet of the project. No privileged function has been added 
 * without careful consideration of its risk profile".
