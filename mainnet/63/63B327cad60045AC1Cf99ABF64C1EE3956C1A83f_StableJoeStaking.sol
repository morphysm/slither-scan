/**
 * @title Stable JOE Staking
 * @author Trader Joe
 * @notice StableJoeStaking is a contract that allows JOE deposits and receives stablecoins sent by MoneyMaker's daily
 * harvests. Users deposit JOE and receive a share of what has been sent by MoneyMaker based on their participation of
 * the total deposited JOE. It is similar to a MasterChef, but we allow for claiming of different reward tokens
 * (in case at some point we wish to change the stablecoin rewarded).
 * Every time `updateReward(token)` is called, We distribute the balance of that tokens as rewards to users that are
 * currently staking inside this contract, and they can claim it using `withdraw(0)`

 *
