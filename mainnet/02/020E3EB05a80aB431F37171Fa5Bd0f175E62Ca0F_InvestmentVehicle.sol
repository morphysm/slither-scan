 * TIP: To avoid leaving the proxy in an uninitialized state, the initializer function should be called as early as

 * applications.
 *
 * Additionally, an {Approval} event is emitted on calls to {transferFrom}.
 * This allows applications to reconstruct the allowance for all accounts just
 * by listening to said events. Other implementations of the EIP may not emit
 * these events, as it isn't required by the specification.

    A very simple system where each participant will buy shares at a fixed price. Each share will count
    against the reward pool that comes from the investment. Each share is an equal part of the reward pie.

    The investment is usually done manually since the investments are off chain or does not allow contract to contract purchase.
    This requires A LOT of trust from each participant as as such should be used with EXTREME caution. There is no safety nest's
    included in this version of the contract. Just keep that in mind.
